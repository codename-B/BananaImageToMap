## Usage:

There are 2 ways to use this plugin, either through bukkit.yml or an external world manager, such as MultiVerse 2.0, that supports custom world generation.  

### Using bukkit.yml:
 
To set up a world using bukkit.yml, insert the following in your bukkit.yml configuration file:  

	worlds:
		{worldname}:
			generator: BananaImageToMap:{imagefile}

Make sure to replace {imagefile} with the name of the file *excluding the extension (though the file must be a .jpg)* that you  
put in your plugins/BananaImageToMap/ folder and {worldname} with the name of the world you wish to genenerate.  

### Using Multiverse 2

Using Multiverse 2, which is to the best of my knowledge the only world management plugin that supports custom generators, the command is  

	/mvcreate {worldname} NORMAL -g BananaImageToMap:{imagename}

Again, replacing {worldname} and {imagename} with the world and image name respectfully. After that you can use it like any normal MV world.
